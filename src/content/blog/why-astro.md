# Why We Chose Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that focuses on content-first websites. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default, making it incredibly fast.

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero JS by Default**: Astro renders HTML on the server and strips away unused JavaScript.
2. **Islands Architecture**: Hydrate only the interactive parts of your page.
3. **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management.

We love using Astro for our projects!
